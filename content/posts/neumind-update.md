I have just published an update on our first years technical progress at neumind. You can read it [here](https://www.neumind.co.uk/blog/neumind-technology-our-first-year/). 

There are many adjectives to describe the last year (2020), but it is very exciting to be trying to launch a startup. I wish everyone all the best for 2021!
